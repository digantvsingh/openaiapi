# CreateChatCompletionRequest

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**messages** | [**List&lt;ChatCompletionRequestMessage&gt;**](ChatCompletionRequestMessage.md) | A list of messages comprising the conversation so far. Depending on the [model](/docs/models) you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like [text](/docs/guides/text-generation), [images](/docs/guides/vision), and [audio](/docs/guides/audio).  | 
**modalities** | [**ResponseModalities**](ResponseModalities.md) |  |  [optional]
**reasoningEffort** | [**ReasoningEffort**](ReasoningEffort.md) |  |  [optional]
**maxCompletionTokens** | **Integer** | An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion, including visible output tokens and [reasoning tokens](/docs/guides/reasoning).  |  [optional]
**frequencyPenalty** | [**BigDecimal**](BigDecimal.md) | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model&#x27;s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.  |  [optional]
**presencePenalty** | [**BigDecimal**](BigDecimal.md) | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model&#x27;s likelihood to talk about new topics.  |  [optional]
**webSearchOptions** | [**WebSearch**](WebSearch.md) |  |  [optional]
**topLogprobs** | **Integer** | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. &#x60;logprobs&#x60; must be set to &#x60;true&#x60; if this parameter is used.  |  [optional]
**responseFormat** | **Object** | An object specifying the format that the model must output.  Setting to &#x60;{ \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;json_schema\&quot;, \&quot;json_schema\&quot;: {...} }&#x60; enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).  Setting to &#x60;{ \&quot;type\&quot;: \&quot;json_object\&quot; }&#x60; enables the older JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON. Using &#x60;json_schema&#x60; is preferred for models that support it.  |  [optional]
**serviceTier** | [**ServiceTierEnum**](#ServiceTierEnum) | Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:   - If set to &#x27;auto&#x27;, and the Project is Scale tier enabled, the system     will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.   - If set to &#x27;auto&#x27;, and the Project is not Scale tier enabled, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - If set to &#x27;default&#x27;, the request will be processed using the default service tier with a lower uptime SLA and no latency guarentee.   - When not set, the default behavior is &#x27;auto&#x27;.    When this parameter is set, the response body will include the &#x60;service_tier&#x60; utilized.  |  [optional]
**audio** | [**CreateChatCompletionRequestAudio**](CreateChatCompletionRequestAudio.md) |  |  [optional]
**store** | **Boolean** | Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for  use in our [model distillation](/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](/docs/guides/evals) products.  |  [optional]
**stream** | **Boolean** | If set to true, the model response data will be streamed to the client as it is generated using [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format). See the [Streaming section below](/docs/api-reference/chat/streaming) for more information, along with the [streaming responses](/docs/guides/streaming-responses) guide for more information on how to handle the streaming events.  |  [optional]
**stop** | [**StopConfiguration**](StopConfiguration.md) |  |  [optional]
**logitBias** | **Map&lt;String, Integer&gt;** | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  |  [optional]
**logprobs** | **Boolean** | Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the &#x60;content&#x60; of &#x60;message&#x60;.  |  [optional]
**maxTokens** | **Integer** | The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.  This value is now deprecated in favor of &#x60;max_completion_tokens&#x60;, and is not compatible with [o1 series models](/docs/guides/reasoning).  |  [optional]
**n** | **Integer** | How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep &#x60;n&#x60; as &#x60;1&#x60; to minimize costs. |  [optional]
**prediction** | **Object** | Configuration for a [Predicted Output](/docs/guides/predicted-outputs), which can greatly improve response times when large parts of the model response are known ahead of time. This is most common when you are regenerating a file with only minor changes to most of the content.  |  [optional]
**seed** | **Integer** | This feature is in Beta. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same &#x60;seed&#x60; and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the &#x60;system_fingerprint&#x60; response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.  |  [optional]
**streamOptions** | [**ChatCompletionStreamOptions**](ChatCompletionStreamOptions.md) |  |  [optional]
**tools** | [**List&lt;ChatCompletionTool&gt;**](ChatCompletionTool.md) | A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for. A max of 128 functions are supported.  |  [optional]
**toolChoice** | [**ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption**](ChatCompletionToolChoiceOption.md) |  |  [optional]
**parallelToolCalls** | **Boolean** |  |  [optional]
**functionCall** | **Object** | Deprecated in favor of &#x60;tool_choice&#x60;.  Controls which (if any) function is called by the model.  &#x60;none&#x60; means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message.  &#x60;auto&#x60; means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function.  Specifying a particular function via &#x60;{\&quot;name\&quot;: \&quot;my_function\&quot;}&#x60; forces the model to call that function.  &#x60;none&#x60; is the default when no functions are present. &#x60;auto&#x60; is the default if functions are present.  |  [optional]
**functions** | [**List&lt;ChatCompletionFunctions&gt;**](ChatCompletionFunctions.md) | Deprecated in favor of &#x60;tools&#x60;.  A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.  |  [optional]
